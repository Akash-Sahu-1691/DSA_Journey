 How to measure the codes using Big O
5 Rules
Rule 1
Rule 2 Rule 3
Rule 4 Rule 5
You should be warned that some declarations may include initializations and some of these may be complex enough to factor into the efficiency of an algorithm.
    No
Description
  Any assignment statements and if statements that are executed once regardless of the size of the problem
 A simple “for” loop from 0 to n ( with no internal loops)
 A nested loop of the same type takes quadratic time complexity
 A loop, in which the controlling parameter is divided by two at each step

Complexity
O(1)
O(n)
O(n2)
O(log n)
 When dealing with multiple statements, just add them up
